# Employment/Legal entity

For content creators, it is important to think about their labour situation. As content creators under the law are not deemed to be employees of the platform for which the creator makes content, different options need to be explored in order to choose the best one for each creator.
 
As for every other person thinking about starting a business, it is important for subscription-based platform content creators to think about how they would like to set up their company.
 
There are several different ways this could be done, and there are both pros and cons with all of them.
 
## Limited Liability Company. 
The most common business vehicle in Hong Kong is a Limited Liability Company. A limited liability company offers protection of personal assets from business risks and liabilities and is a separate legal entity.
 
### Advantages:
- Separate Legal Entity: A private limited company has a legal identity of its own, distinct from its members. This enables the company to acquire assets, go into debt, enter into contracts, sue or be sued in its own name.
- Limited Liability: The liability of the shareholders is limited to the amount of their respective shareholdings/investment.
- Perpetual Succession: A change of membership does not affect the company’s continued existence. Shares can be easily transferred and changes in shareholders have no bearing on the business operations of the company. This means the company has perpetual succession notwithstanding the death, resignation or insolvency of shareholders or directors.
- Ease of Raising Capital: Business expansion is facilitated by the ease of raising finances, by bringing in new shareholders or issuing more shares to existing shareholders. It is easier for limited companies to secure bank loans when compared to other business entity types.
- Positive Image: Private limited companies are taken more seriously when compared to sole proprietorships and partnerships and investors are more willing to contribute their resources to private limited companies.
- Easier Transfer of Ownership: Complete or partial transfer of ownership of companies can be done by selling all or part of its total shares, or through the issue of new shares to additional investors. Business operations can continue unaffected and legal documentation is not complicated.
- Tax Benefits and Incentives: There are several tax benefits that private limited companies enjoy in Hong Kong. Corporate tax, (or profits tax as it is called), is set at 16.5% of assessable profits for corporations. Hong Kong follows a territorial basis of taxation. Hence, only profits which arise in or derived from Hong Kong are subject to tax in Hong Kong. There is no capital gains tax, withholding tax on dividends and interest and no sales tax or VAT in Hong Kong.

### Disadvantages:
- Complex to Set Up: A private limited company is generally considered more complex, expensive and complicated to establish when compared to sole proprietorships and partnerships.
- On-going Compliance: There are a number of statutory compliance requirements that private limited companies must adhere to.
- Disclosure Requirements: A company has to make certain information available (capital structure, personal particulars of shareholders, directors and secretary etc.) to the public by filing returns with the Companies Registry.
- Complex Winding-up Procedures: Closing a company is more complex, time consuming and expensive when compared to other business entities.
 
## Sole Proprietorship. 
Suitable for small scale and low risk businesses with a sole owner, sole proprietorships are easy to set up. However, it does not constitute a separate legal entity and does not protect the owner’s personal assets from business liabilities.
 
### Advantages:
- Simple to Establish: Sole Proprietorships are known for simple and easy setting up procedures.
- Easy Decision Making: Given the fact that the sole proprietor retains complete control over all business affairs, decision making is fast and efficient, without having to seek approval from others.
- Sole Beneficiary of Profits: Sole proprietors do not have to share profits derived from the business.
- Ease of Termination: Terminating a sole proprietorship is easier, less time consuming and less expensive than other business entities.
Disadvantages:
- No Separate Legal Entity: Sole proprietorships are not a separate legal entity and the owner and business are considered one and the same. The sole proprietor is responsible for all debts and liabilities.
- Unlimited Personal Liability: In cases of debts incurred, there is no protection of personal assets (including your property).
- Limited Capital: The only source of capital is the sole proprietor’s personal finances and business generated profits. With limited working capital business growth and expansion is deterred.
- Limited Life of the Business: There is no perpetual succession of sole proprietorships, which cease to exist on the death of the sole proprietor.
- Low public perception: Due to the risks posed by this form of business, investors are less confident and sourcing for finance becomes difficult.
- Sale/Transfer of All or Part of the Business: You can transfer the business only by the sale of business assets.
 
 
## Partnership

This business structure allows two or more people to share ownership of a single business. Partnerships enable a sharing of responsibility and increases the ability to raise funds. However, partners are jointly and individually liable for the actions of the other partners. The most common form of partnership is a Limited Partnership, as it offers limited liability to limited partners.
