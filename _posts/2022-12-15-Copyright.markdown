# What do I do if somebody uses my photograph or video without consent? 
 
First of all, determine whether you have copyright in the work. 

## What is copyright? 
 
Copyright is a bundle of exclusive rights granted to the owner of an original work. Some of these rights include the exclusive right to copy the work, issue copies of the work or make it available to the public, perform, broadcast or show the work in public, and make an adaptation of the work.


Therefore, if I have a copyright in my photograph and somebody copies it, it is copyright infringement because only I have the exclusive right to copy the work. 

In Hong Kong, copyright law is regulated by the Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528). 
 
## How do I know if I have copyright in my work? 
 
You must have 1) a work 2) that is original

### What is a work? 
A work includes literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works (such as photographs), films, sound recordings and broadcasts. If a work falls within one of these categories, it will be protected by copyright if it’s original. 
### What is an original work? 
Originality means that the author must’ve exercised some labor, skill and/or judgement in producing the work. 

For example, if I take a photo of myself, my friends or a mountain, I will have copyright in the photo. The photo is a work (artistic work) and it is original because I exercise my labor, skill and judgement in photographing a particular scene.
 
## Do I have to apply somewhere to get copyright? 
No, it is not necessary to register a copyright in Hong Kong (in fact, there is no copyright registration system in HK!). As long as you create an original work, you will automatically get the copyright for it. 
 
## How long will my copyright last?

In HK, it depends on the format of the work, but in most cases it will last 50 years after the death of the author. 
 
## What do I do if someone infringes my copyright? What are my remedies?
If somebody violates one of your exclusive rights to the work, you can sue for copyright infringement. 


If infringement is established, you can get: 
 1) an injunction (to prevent the infringer from continuing to infringe your rights) 
 
 2) damages (financial compensation for the infringing conduct) and 
 
 3) account of profits (order requiring infringer to pay you the profits it earned as a result of infringing conduct). 
 
The time limit is 6 years to bring a claim for breach of copyright and time starts running from the date the damage is suffered. 
 
## Can the person being sued defend themselves? 
Yes, there are several to defenses to copyright infringement. They include claims that:
- Copyright has expired
- Copyright doesn’t subsist in work (e.g. it’s not original or it’s not a work)
- Fair dealing – some copying is allowed for purposes of research, private study, education, criticism, review, etc. 
 
## I think someone has stolen my content and infringed my copyright. What do I do? 
First, contact your social media platform. They may have an internal process or staff that can help you with the process. 

If your social media platform doesn’t have an internal process, see if you can contact the person who has stolen your content and let them know that could be infringing your copyright. Ask them to take down the content. 

If these methods don’t work, seek legal counsel.
