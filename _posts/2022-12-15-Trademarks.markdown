# Why is trademark relevant to my content?
One way to protect your content from being stolen is to add a watermark to your photos and videos. This way, you will establish that your content belongs to you and content thieves will be more reluctant to steal it. This watermark can be in the form of a trademark to represent your brand. 

# What exactly is a trademark? 
According to the World Intellectual Property Office, a trademark is any word, phrase, symbol design or combination of these things that identifies your goods or services. It allows others to recognize you in your marketplace and distinguish yourself from competitors.

# How do I make a trademark?
Use your creativity! But there a few things you need to ensure:
 - Your trademark needs to be represented graphically
 - The trademark cannot have any description of your goods/services – for example, if you are selling handbags, the trademark cannot have the word “hand bags” in it. 
 - It needs to be unique and distinctive – it cannot be similar to another trademark that has already been made. There are two ways to determine whether someone has a similar trademark to your proposed trademark: 
    - Use the Search and Preliminary Advice services of the Trade Marks Registry office. They will do a search of records to determine whether there are any trademarks that are the same as or similar to your proposed trademark. If you wish to use this service, fill out [this form](https://www.ipd.gov.hk/eng/forms_fees/trademarks_559/t1_notice_pdf.html) and submit it with the appropriate fee to the Registry.
    - Search the Trademark Registry’s records yourself. Go to [esearch.ipd.gov.hk](esearch.ipd.gov.hk) to search the database.

# I have my trademark ready. What now? Do I need to register my trademark? 
You don’t need to register your trademark, but it will make it easier to protect your trademark in case somebody copies it.

Fill out [this form](https://www.ipd.gov.hk/eng/forms_fees/trademarks_559/t2_notice_pdf.html) and attach the required fee. Submit your application to the following address: Trade Marks Registry Intellectual Property Department 24/F, Wu Chung House, Wanchai, 213 Queen’s Road East, Hong Kong.

Approval should take approximately 6 months from your application date. 

# Can my trademark be refused? 
Yes, it can be refused for several reasons including: 
-  Fails to satisfy the definition of a trademark
-  Mark is not distinctive
-  Mark is not unique
-  Mark is descriptive of your goods/services
-  Mark is contrary to accepted principles of morality (e.g. uses swear words)
- Mark can deceive the public
- Mark consists of the Chinese national flag or emblem or the Hong Kong regional flag or emblem.

# How long will my trademark last? 
After a trademark has been successfully registered, it will remain registered for 10 years (although you can renew it beyond this period). 

However, a trademark needs to be continuously used or you may lose it! In Hong Kong, if a trademark is not used for a period of 3 years, it can be revoked.
